### Hey, I'm Alfred!

My passion is building things in data, machine learning, and/or finance. I love exploring how code can be used to find patterns, model complex systems, and create something new.

#### A few things I'm currently exploring:

* Using data to understand and predict business outcomes or whatever is interesting
* Playing with art generation models like Stable Diffusion
* Finding new ways to price financial options at high speeds
* Building bots that spot and exploit inefficiencies in real-time markets
